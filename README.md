### Hi there, I'm Malaya! 👋

🌺 Pronouns: She/Her/Hers

🔍 I am currently #OpenToWork! I am a cybersecurity junior professional with a passion for governance, risk, and compliance.

In my previous role I worked as a customer success manager, and I have 2 years of customer-facing experience providing helpdesk and product support for B2B SaaS startups. 

I am a highly analytical and data-driven individual who thrives in fast-paced, results-oriented environments. I enjoy working collaboratively and building strong relationships with cross-functional teams and all stakeholders. I am interested in working for companies that value a people-first philosophy, empathy, and psychological safety.

🌱 I am a lifelong learner, and am currently learning Python to build and strengthen my technical skills!

🌷 Prior to my career in technology, I worked as a social worker for many community-based organizations as a case manager, health educator, and care coordinator. Many of the organizations I've worked for focus on serving the LGBTQ+ community, people living with HIV/AIDS, and youth/young adults (TAY services, ages 13-24).

### Hi there, I'm Malaya! 👋

🌺 Pronouns: She/Her/Hers

🔍 I am currently #OpenToWork! I am a cybersecurity junior professional with a strong interest in governance, risk, and compliance.

In my previous roles I have worked as a customer success manager, with 2 years of remote customer-facing experience providing helpdesk and product support for B2B SaaS startups. 

I am a highly analytical and data-driven individual who thrives in fast-paced, results-oriented environments. I enjoy working collaboratively and building strong relationships with cross-functional teams and all stakeholders. I am interested in working for companies that value a people-first philosophy, empathy, and psychological safety.

🌱 I am a lifelong learner, and I am currently learning Linux Foundations (LFS101) and Fundamentals of Open Source IT and Cloud Computing (LFS200) in preparation for my Linux Foundation Certified IT Associate (LFCA) Certification!
